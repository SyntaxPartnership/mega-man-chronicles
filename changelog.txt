Map FAQ and Tile IDs

The map is made up of 3 layers.
	Room Layer		(Invisible to player)
	Collision Layer		(Invisible to player)
	Graphic Layer		(Visible to player)

Room:		Only used to make scrolling and tile
		placement easier.

Collision:	Tiles used for collision in the game.
		Contains tiles for any and all obstacles.

Graphic:	Graphic tiles that the player will actually
		be seeing in game.

Tile IDs:

-1:	Nothing.
0:	Floor/Wall/Ceilings.
1:	Snow. (Player runs at 1/2 speed).
2:	Ice. (Player subject to ice physics when running).
3:	Top of ladder. (Player can stand on top)
4:	Ladder
5:	Death traps. (Instantly kills the player.)
6:	Water. (Player can jump 3 times normal height.)
7:	Water Top. (Play splash animation when player
	enters tile.)
8:	Slow Right Conveyor.
9:	Fast Right Conveyor.
10:	Slow Left Conveyor.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes - Version 0.0.1 ():

-	Camera system started.
-	READY at start of stage is complete.
-	Added player spawn point functions.
-	Added basic animations.
-	Added the ground work for the swap mechanic.
-	Running added.
-	Tweaked the run function to use fewer lines of
	code.
-	Jumping added.
-	Fixed an issue where the jump sprite would briefly
	appear after the player beams in. This will
	potentially help fix the same issue when reaching
	the top of a ladder.
-	Added a function to determine what kind of floor
	the player is standing on.
-	Added function to determine what type of tile the
	player is overlapping.
-	Fixed an issue where the player's Y velocity would
	keep increasing the more they fell.
-	Added water physics.
-	Tweaked jump code to make it easier to read.
-	Fixed an issue where holding jump would let the
	player jump repeatedly.
-	Fixed an issue where holding jump after falling off
	a platform would make the player jump upon contact
	with an obstacle.
-	Ice physics added.
-	Fixed an issue where the player's "little step"
	would not move them in the direction the player
	is facing.
-	Fixed and issue where the player would stop at the
	edge of ice/conveyor tiles instead of falling off
	the side.
-	Added ladders.
-	Added a function to determine what type of tile the
	player is colliding with. (Mostly will be used for
	death traps).
-	Tweaked water gravity to be more in line with the
	NES games.
-	Added ladder tiles specifically for use in water.
-	Fixed an issue where pulling the tile_name of a
	tile would spit out THOUSANDS of errors when not
	colliding.
-	Sliding added for Mega Man.
-	Fixed issues with sliding on certain tiles.
-	COMPLETELY redid the X and Y movements for running.
	I totally overcomplicated the whole thing.
-	Redid the top of ladder detection. Makes for a more
	stable dismount.
-	Moved gravity functions outside of the main 3
	states, as gravity will affect players unless they
	are climbing.
-	Fixed an issue when the player reaches the top of
	an underwater ladder.
-	Dashing added for Proto Man/Bass.
-	Fixed an issue regarding the X Speed Modifier not
	resetting when no collision is taking place.
-	Fixed ANOTHER issue with the tops of ladders after
	the last fix broke ALL ladders.
-	Fixed an issue where the player would continue
	being pushed along as if on a conveyor when
	standing on 'Death' tiles. (Hilarious. But had to
	go).
-	Damage functions added.
-	Fixed an issue when taking damage while caught
	under a low ceiling.
-	Fixed an issue where taking damage while sliding,
	but the player was NOT under a low ceiling, caused
	the player to continue their slide when the hurt
	animation was finished.
-	Fixed an issue with how direction swapping is
	handled on ladders.
-	Fixed an issue where the player would still climb
	ladders while in a shooting/throwing state.
-	Fixed an issue when using a throwing weapon or Bass
	defaut buster displaying the wrong animations.
-	Added shoot functions.
-	Added throw functions.
-	Added bass buster shot functions.
-	Deleted and redid Bass' Buster functions because
	he's an asshole and every time I try to add
	something new it's BASS that breaks something and
	FUCK that fish headed ass hat I HATE HIM WITH EVERY
	OUNCE OF MY BEING!! )()$&&%^%&$*(^$(*$^*(^(&%%&!!!
	...
	...
	...
	...
	I'm better now.
-	FINALLY fixed Bass' Buster behaviors.
-	Fixed an issue where dashing against a wall would
	allow the player to dash endlessly along the floor
	when no obstacle is present.
-	Fixed dash jumping for Bass so he could grab
	ladders and shoot.
-	Added functions for debugging.
-	Merged Standing and Sliding into a single function
	to help clean up code and make it more manageable.
-	Fixed multiple bugs as a result of the merger.
-	Fixed an issue where dashing while shooting as Bass
	would cause him to dash and shoot at the same time
	rather than cancel the shooting action.
-	Started title screen.
-	Redid the Fade In scene to use tweens instead of
	setting the opacity manually. Much smoother
	looking.
-	Fixed an issue where the player's sprite would
	disappear while shooting, holding up or down, then
	double tapping a direction to make Bass dash.
-	Fixed an issue where Mega Man could jump while
	under a low ceiling, therefore getting stuck.
-	Fixed an issue where Mega Man retained his slide
	momentum when jumping after a slide.
